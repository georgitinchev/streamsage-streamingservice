# StreamSage Movie Streaming Service

## Project Overview

StreamSage is a comprehensive movie streaming application built using **C# .NET** and **.NET Core**. It integrates **Windows Forms** and **Razor Pages** for a seamless and interactive user interface. The application connects to a **SQL database** to provide access to a library of over **3,000 movies**. 

### Key Features:
- **Movie Interpretations**: Allows users to share and read insightful analyses and interpretations of film plots, offering a deeper engagement than standard reviews.
- **Advanced Recommendation Algorithms**: Recommends movies based on user preferences, viewing history, and ratings.
- **Personalized Watchlists**: Users can curate and manage their own collection of movies to watch later.
- **Recently Watched Section**: Displays a list of recently viewed movies for easy access.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in **software development**, **database management**, and **UI/UX design**, while providing an engaging and personalized movie streaming experience.

> **Note**: While the app contains a large library of over 3,000 movies, users are currently only able to watch the trailers. This is due to copyright restrictions and the nature of the project.
